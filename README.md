**1. N-Queen problem using uniform cost search:**

    The code solves the N-queen problem using UCS. First an empty chessboard is taken which is considered
    the initial state. The children of the state are the possible queen positions in the next unfilled column
    to the right. The step cost for each child is 1 units and the open list is implemented using a min priority queue.
    Edit the N value in the code and recompile to generate solutions.
